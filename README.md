## The ways to versioning Blog App REST APIs

1. Versioning through URI Path
- One way to version a REST API is to include the version number in the URI path.
#### Examples:
- http://www.example.com/api/1/products 
- http://www.example.com/api/v1/products

2. Versioning through query parameters
- Another option for versioning a REST API is to include the version number as a query parameter.
#### Examples:
- http://www.example.com/api/products?version=1 
- http://www.example.com/api/products?version=2

3. Versioning through custom headers
- REST APIs can also be versioned by providing custom headers with the version number included as an attribute.
- The main difference between this approach and the two previous ones is that it doesn’t clutter the URI with versioning information.
#### Examples:
- http://localhost:8080/api/products headers=[X-API-VERSION=1]
- http://localhost:8080/api/products headers=[X-API-VERSION=2]
##### Pros: It doesn’t clutter the URI with versioning information
##### Cons: It requires custom headers

4. Versioning through content negotiation
- The last strategy we are addressing is versioning through content negotiation.
- In this approach, we use the Accept header in the request.
#### Examples:
- http://localhost:8080/api/products headers[Accept=application/vnd.javaguides-v1+json] 
- http://localhost:8080/api/products headers[Accept=application/vnd.javaguides-v2+json]

## REST Documentation with Swagger
### Why the Swagger is used for
Swagger is used for answer those questions between REST API Developer and REST API Consumer
- What are rest endpoints available
- What is response codes
- What is dto structure
- What are error codes
- What are HTTP methods
- What are standart error messages
